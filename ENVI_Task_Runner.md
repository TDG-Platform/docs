# ENVI Task Runner



In general the ENVI task runner is an interface to the ENVI task engine. Part of this interface is to provide support for the various ENVI data types, which are far more complex then the GBDX types (string, directory). This document will cover the more complicated use case of specific ENVI data types, that cannot be covered by the various documents for each ENVI task. The following are the currently supported ENVI data types and their GBDX type:



|        ENVI Data Type        | GBDX Type |
| :--------------------------: | :-------: |
|           ENVIURI            | Directory |
|          ENVIRaster          | Directory |
|          ENVIGCPSet          | Directory |
|           ENVIROI            | Directory |
|     ENVISpectralLibrary      | Directory |
|       ENVITiePointSet        | Directory |
|          ENVIVector          | Directory |
|         ENVICoordSys         |  String   |
|      ENVIGridDefinition      |  String   |
|  ENVIPseudoRasterSpatialRef  |  String   |
| ENVIStandardRasterSpatialRef |  String   |
|         ENVIGeoJson          |  String   |
