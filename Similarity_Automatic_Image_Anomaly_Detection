# Similarity: Automatic Image Anomaly Detection System (aiads)

The algorithm takes a candidate image, and a historical set of images which intersect the candidate and precede it in time, and produces a heat map image of the same dimensions as the candidate, which marks anomalous regions as red and non-anomalous regions as blue or transparent.
Both candidates and historical images must be AComp and DRA corrected, as well as being pan-sharpened. Lower off-nadir angles are preferred, but images with significant off-nadir angles have been successfully processed.
This File documents the use of the GBDX version of AIADS

The Task takes as its input, a directory which is output by the AOP_strip_processor
task (or an equivalent directory structure) and outputs an image file which is a
heat map of anomalies in a "candidate" image.

taskname can be run with Python using [gbdxtools](https://github.com/DigitalGlobe/gbdxtools) or through the [GBDX Web Application](https://gbdx.geobigdata.io/materials/).
